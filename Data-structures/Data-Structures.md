# Data Structures

### What are Data Structures?
    - A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.
    The idea is to reduce the space and time complexities of different tasks by using the correct data structure/s.

### What is a Linear Data Structures?
    - Linear means arranged in or extending along a straight or nearly straight line.

    - So given the meaning of the word Linear, a Linear Data Structure is a collection of data where the data elements are stored and arranged in a strait line with each data element aligned one after the other.
    
    - In a Linear Data Structure, there's only a single level involved, therefore, the data elements can be traversed all in a single run only.
    
    - Linear Data Structure are easy to implement because computer memory is also arranged in a linear way.

### Give examples of Linear Data Structures.
    1. **Arrays** are linear, because the data is stored as a collection of data elements next or together in sequence with one being attached after another at contiguous memory locations.

    2. **Linked List** are linear, because just like arrays there data is also stored next or together in sequence. But unlike Arrays the data is not stored in contiguous memory locations.

    3. A **Stack** is also a linear Data Structure because the data is organized in a sequential manner, with it's data elements being attached one after another. Stacks are viewed in a top-down manner and follows a particular order in which the operations are performed, because of the top-down manner the order can be "*FILO*" (first in, last out) or "*LIFO*" (last in, first out).

    4. A **Queue** is also a linear Data Structure, with its data elements having been organized sequentially. Queue's are viewed in a left-to-right manner and Like a Stack, a Queue follows a particular order in which operations are performed, but unlike the Stack which has a top-down manner, the Queue's left-right manner means that order will be "*FIFO*" (first in, first out).

### What is a Non-Linear Data Structures?
    - In a Non-Linear Data Structure, data elements are attached in hierarchically (hierarchy) manner.

    - Hierarchy means an arrangement of items in which the items are represented as being "above", "below", or "at the same level as" one another.

    - So given the meaning of the word hierarchy, a Non-Linear Data Structure is a collection of data where the data elements are stored either above, below, or next to one another.

    - In a Non-Linear Data Structure, unlike Linear Data Structures there is multiple levels involved, therefore, the data elements can not be traversed all in a single run.

    - Non-Linear Data Structures are not as easy to implement when compared to that of Linear Data Structures, but unlike Linear Data Structures it utilizes computer memory in a more efficient manner.

### Give examples of Non-Linear Data Structures.
    1. **Trees** are non-linear, because the data is stored in a hierarchical manner with it's data elements starting with a root (parent) node and the rest of the data elements forming a tree like structure consisted of one or more subtree (child) nodes.

    2. **Graphs** are also non-linear, like Trees there data is also stored in a hierarchy. But unlike Trees where all connections come from the root node, A Graph can have connections come from any node to any other node.
