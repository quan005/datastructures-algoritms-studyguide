# Linked List

### What is it?
    - A **Linked List** is a collection of data elements stored at contiguous (next to one another) memory locations. The idea is to store multiple data elements of the same type together, which makes it easy to calculate the position of each element by simply adding the index of the selected element to the base value.

### When to use it?
    - It's good to use an **Array whenever there's a small data set and you don't have to search through each element of data in order to find what you're searching for. This is because whenever you use an array the time complexity (big-O notation) is increased with each element added, giving it a linear time complexity (O(n)).

### Explain it to a fifth grader.
    - You can think of an **Array** as a fleet of stairs and a friend is standing on each step. You can identify the location of each friend by simply the count of the step that they're standing on.

### What are the various operations that can be performed?
    1. Traverse − print all the array elements one by one.

    2. Insertion − Adds an element at the given index.

    3. Deletion − Deletes an element at the given index.

    4. Search − Searches an element using the given index or by the value.

    5. Update − Updates an element at the given index.
